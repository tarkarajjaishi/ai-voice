# Outbound Calling — Outbound Campaign Dialer

Outbound calling is available through **Admin UI → Call Scheduling**. The v7.5.0
release retains AAVA-managed scheduling for FreePBX and generic Asterisk deployments.
VICIdial deployments must use the separate
[VICIdial Remote Agent integration](Vicidial-Setup.md), which keeps campaign and
terminal-state ownership in VICIdial.

This feature adds a simple, AI-native outbound dialer inspired by Vicidial-style campaigns, but designed to stay aligned with AAVA’s **ARI-first** architecture and Admin UI model.

## What You Get (v1)

- **Campaign scheduler** (campaign timezone + daily window)
- **Lead intake via CSV, Excel (`.xlsx`), or manual entry** using an active Agent slug (safe default: `skip_existing`)
- **Pacing + concurrency** (`max_concurrent` caps campaign activity; the safety ramp starts at most one new lead per scheduler tick)
- **Asterisk AMD voicemail detection** (`AMD()`)
- **Voicemail drop** (play a pre-recorded message and hang up)
- **Consent gate (optional)**: play a consent prompt and capture DTMF (`1` accept / `2` deny)
- **Recording library**: upload once, reuse across campaigns

## Key Assumptions

- Your **outbound trunk(s)** and **outbound routes** are already configured in Asterisk/FreePBX.
- AAVA originates outbound calls using your configured **outbound identity extension** (default `6789`), so FreePBX routing and caller-ID rules apply consistently.
- This is a **single-node** design.

## Architecture (High Level)

- **Control plane**: scheduler + SQLite state (stored alongside Call History DB).
- **Media plane**: once answered, the call attaches to the existing AAVA session lifecycle.
- **AMD**: the engine sends the answered channel into dialplan via ARI `continueInDialplan` to run `AMD()` and return to Stasis with an outcome.
- **NOTSURE** is treated as MACHINE by default to avoid burning AI sessions.

## Environment Variables

See `docs/Configuration-Reference.md` for the full list and semantics. The most common:

- `AAVA_OUTBOUND_EXTENSION_IDENTITY` (default `6789`)
- `AAVA_OUTBOUND_AMD_CONTEXT` (default `aava-outbound-amd`)
- `AAVA_OUTBOUND_ATTEMPT_STALE_SECONDS` (default `120`, minimum `10`; shared by startup and runtime cleanup)
- `AAVA_MEDIA_DIR` (default `/mnt/asterisk_media/ai-generated`)

## Agent Routing

- New campaigns and CSV files should select an active Agent **slug** from the Agents page.
- The downloadable sample CSV uses the preferred `agent` column. The older `context` column remains accepted as a deprecated compatibility alias.
- Excel imports use the first worksheet and the same columns and validation as CSV. Keep phone numbers and extensions formatted as text when leading zeros matter; numeric cells with an explicit all-zero number format are preserved.
- Manual entry, CSV, and Excel all share the same validation, Agent fallback, timezone fallback, and per-campaign duplicate rules.
- Outbound origination sets `AI_AGENT` as the canonical routing variable and also carries `AI_CONTEXT` through the AMD dialplan hop for v7.4 compatibility. When both are present, `AI_AGENT` wins.
- Existing database/API field names such as `default_context` and `context_override` remain unchanged in 7.4.1 to avoid a breaking schema or automation migration; their values are treated as Agent slugs in the UI and runtime.

## 7.4.1 Number and Scheduling Semantics

- For scheduled outbound HUMAN calls, both `caller_number` and `called_number` expose the lead/customer number to prompts and tools. This preserves the existing outbound `caller_number` behavior and fixes pre-call URLs such as `?phone={called_number}`.
- Invalid IANA timezones, malformed daily `HH:MM` values, malformed/reversed absolute windows, and unexpected validation errors fail closed: the campaign does not originate a call.
- Daily start and end values must use zero-padded 24-hour `HH:MM`. Equal values continue to mean a 24-hour window; cross-midnight windows remain supported.
- An active outbound HUMAN call is counted once against `max_concurrent`, even while its in-memory attempt correlation remains active.
- The scheduler intentionally leases at most one new lead per tick. `min_interval_seconds_between_calls` can further slow origination but does not increase the configured concurrency ceiling.

## Setup Steps (FreePBX-friendly)

1. Update to AAVA `v7.5.0` and start `admin_ui` + `ai_engine`.
2. In Admin UI, open **Call Scheduling** and create a campaign.
3. Configure (optional):
   - Consent gate
   - Voicemail drop
   - AMD tuning
4. Open the campaign **Setup Guide** tab and copy the generated dialplan snippet into:
   - `/etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf`
5. Reload dialplan:
   - `asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"`
6. Import leads via CSV/Excel or add them manually. Use the preferred `agent` field and an active Agent slug, then click **Start**.

### Lead intake limits

- CSV and `.xlsx` files are accepted; legacy `.xls`, macro-enabled `.xlsm`, and other spreadsheet formats are rejected.
- `.xlsx` reads only the first worksheet, up to 64 columns and 10,000 lead rows by default.
- Uploads default to a 10 MiB limit, and compressed workbooks may expand to at most 50 MiB.
- Operators can tune the upload and worksheet row limits with `AAVA_OUTBOUND_LEAD_IMPORT_MAX_BYTES` and `AAVA_OUTBOUND_LEAD_IMPORT_MAX_ROWS`.
- The downloadable sample CSV remains the canonical column reference: `name`, `phone_number`, `agent`, `timezone`, `caller_id`, and `custom_vars`.

## Testing Checklist (New User)

Use a local extension (e.g., `2765`) and an external number (E.164) to validate:

- Consent enabled: press `1` to accept → AI connects; press `2` → call ends; no input → `consent_timeout`.
- Voicemail enabled: let it ring out or go to voicemail → voicemail drop plays; attempt outcome recorded.
- HUMAN path: correct Agent/provider chosen; tools (e.g., `hangup_call`) work.

## Where to Look When Something Breaks

- Admin UI → **Call Scheduling**:
  - Lead “Last Error”, “Outcome”, “AMD”, “DTMF”, and “Call History” modal
- Engine logs:
  - `docker compose logs -f ai_engine`
- Asterisk console:
  - `asterisk -rvvvvv`
- First-line setup fixes:
  - `sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes`
  - `agent check`
  - `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`
